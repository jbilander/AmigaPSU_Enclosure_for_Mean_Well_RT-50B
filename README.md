Cabling is taken from an old dead Amiga 500 PSU. Also the power switch is reused and a couple of power resistors is added to put a dummy load to satisfy the minimum load requirements stated in the datasheet for the Mean Well RT-50B PSU.

Attention: Read the <a href="LEGAL_DISCLAIMER.md">Legal Disclaimer</a> before doing any electrical work yourself.

First strip the two leads on the power switch and attach two terminal blocks. Adjust the cable length and cut the Line lead (brown) and connect to terminal block like in picture. Blue is Neutral (return lead) and green/yellow is GND/Earth. Carefully cut the isolation if needed. Do not cut into the leads themselves.
